# Dust Assistant for Google Spreadsheets

> **Beta Disclaimer**: This integration is currently in beta. Features and functionality are subject to change as we continue to improve the product based on user feedback and testing.

## 1. Introduction

The Dust Assistant for Google Spreadsheets is an App Script that allows users to interact with a Dust AI assistant directly from their Google Spreadsheet. This integration brings the power of Dust's AI capabilities to your spreadsheet workflows, enabling more efficient data analysis and task automation.

Note: The App Script needs to be manually added to each spreadsheet where you want to use the Dust Assistant.

## 2. How to Add the App Script to Your Google Spreadsheet

To add the Dust Assistant App Script to your Google Spreadsheet, follow these steps:

1. Open your Google Spreadsheet.
2. Click on the "Extensions" menu at the top of the page.
3. Select "Apps Script" from the dropdown menu.
4. In the Apps Script editor, click on "Add a file" (usually a plus icon).
5. Choose "Script" from the options.
6. Name the file "dust" (or any name you prefer).
7. Replace all the content in the placeholder script with the provided script from the `dust-app-script.js` file.
8. Save the script.

## 3. Configuring the App Script

After adding the App Script to your spreadsheet, you'll need to configure some settings. Here's how to get the required information:

1. Open the App Script editor in your Google Spreadsheet.
2. Locate the following variables in the script:
   - `WORKSPACE_ID`
   - `API_KEY`

To obtain the necessary values:

1. **Workspace ID**:

   - This can be found in your Dust URL.
   - Example: In the URL `https://dust.tt/w/<workspace_id>/assistant/new`, your Workspace ID is the part right after `https://dust.tt/w/`.

2. **API Key**:
   - Log in to your Dust account as an admin or a builder.
   - Navigate to _Build > Developer Tools > API Keys_.
   - Click on "Create an API Key" to generate a new key.

Note: The API Key needs to be generated by an admin or a builder.

## 4. Using the Dust Assistant in Your Spreadsheet

Once you've set up the App Script and configured it with your Workspace ID and API Key, you can start using the Dust Assistant directly in your spreadsheet cells. The general syntax for using the Dust Assistant is:

=DUST(<assistant_name>, <question/prompt>, <cell_reference>)

Here's an example of how you might use it:

### Example: Market Analysis Assistant

Let's say you have a Dust Assistant named "MarketGuru" that specializes in market analysis. You can use it to analyze data in your spreadsheet:

1. In cell A1, you have a list of product names.
2. In cell B1, you want to get a brief market analysis for each product.

You could use the following formula in cell B1:

=DUST("MarketGuru", "Provide a brief market analysis for this product, including current trends and potential growth opportunities:", A1)

This would prompt MarketGuru to analyze the product name in A1 and provide insights in B1. You can then drag this formula down to apply it to multiple products in column A.

The assistant might respond with something like:

"Based on current market trends, [Product Name] shows strong potential for growth. Recent consumer behavior indicates increasing demand in this sector, particularly among millennials. Key opportunities include expanding into e-commerce channels and developing eco-friendly variants to capture the growing sustainability-conscious market segment."

Remember, you can customize the prompt and assistant name based on your specific needs and the assistants you've set up in your Dust workspace.

## 5. Limitations

Please be aware of the following limitations when using the Dust Assistant in Google Spreadsheets:

1. **Response Time**: The assistant must respond within 30 seconds, or the spreadsheet will return an error. Ensure your queries are concise and specific to avoid timeouts.

2. **Daily Message Limit**: Each interaction with a Dust Assistant counts towards the daily message limit of 100 messages per user per day. For example, if your workspace has 100 users, your total daily capacity is 10,000 messages (100 users \* 100 messages).

   Example: If your workspace has 100 users, you have a total capacity of 100 \* 100 = 10,000 messages per day.

By keeping these limitations in mind, you can optimize your use of the Dust Assistant in Google Spreadsheets and ensure a smooth experience for all users in your workspace.
